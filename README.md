# Ascii Jianpu

A jianpu font which uses ascii ligatures to display simplified musical notation.

This is a work in progress, but the font file is at least partially functional.

- Use 0 for a rest
- Use digits 1-7 for notes
- Append `,` to a digit indicate a lower octave.
- Append `'` to indicate a higher octave.
- Append `_` to indicate a shorter note.
