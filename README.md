# Ascii Jianpu

A jianpu font which uses ascii ligatures to display simplified musical notation. 简谱

This is a work in progress, but the font file is at least partially functional.

- Use 0 for a rest
- Use digits 1-7 for notes
- Append `,` to a digit indicate a lower octave.
- Append `'` to indicate a higher octave.
- Append `_` to indicate a shorter note.



## Other Jianpu Typesetting systems.

The advantage of using this font is that the resulting musical notation can be displayed and modified in almost any software.

But of course, there is only so much one can do with font formatting tricks.
And more complex musical notation may require more specialized typesetting software.

- [Simp Erhu](https://simperhu.weebly.com/) is a plugin for Microsoft Word with many specialized symbols for use when playing the erhu. 
- [jianpu-ly](https://github.com/ssb22/jianpu-ly) has its own convention for notating Jianpu in ASCII, but doesn't display the notation itself. Instead it converts the notation into a form which [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/) can render.
- [Fanqie Jianpu](http://zhipu.lezhi99.com/Zhipu-index.html) is a web interface for typing Jianpu, and can render the results as vectors or pdfs.
